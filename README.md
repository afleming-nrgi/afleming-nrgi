- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anna, @afleming-nrgi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing processes that make my data work more efficient and our data more open. I work mostly with datasets related to the governance of natural resources (minerals and oil & gas). 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing on everything I could do before parental leave. Then I'll get on with learning new things! 
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at afleming@resourcegovernance.org
